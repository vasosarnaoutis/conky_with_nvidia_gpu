# conky_with_nvidia_gpu
This is an example of a simple conky file that can operate on the background and display the performance of GPU, CPU and RAM. The code is not entirely mine so I do not take ownership of it. My modifications include the NVIDIA-GPU, proper naming of each component, inclusion of tracking bar for each core of the CPU and alterations in colors and general setup display.
